##  SNP Browser  Software

SNP Browser is a fast and accurate software that allows for genomic data retrieval of SNPs located on chromosome 22 in conjunction with genotype and allele frequencies across populations. A variety of population summary statistics, which include, Nucleotide diversity, Homozygosity, Tajimaâ€™s D, and fixation index (FST) can be computed, which are returned in a tabular format and plotted along sliding windows, with the additional opportunity to download the results as a text file. 


SNP Browser was developed by Genome Analytics, a group composed of four MSc Bioinformatics students from the Queen Mary University of London under the guidance of Professor Conrad Bessant and Dr Matteo Fumagalli.
